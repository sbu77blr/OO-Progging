* Main Aim of OOP - to bind the data along with the function which will operate on them. So, no other code can access this data except for the function.

* Four main features :-
	- Abstraction.
	- Encapsulation.
	- Inheritence.
	- Polymorphism.

* Class - a logical entity used to define a user defined data type. (Usually modelling a real world entity)
	- Contains data members (variables), methods and constructors.
	- Data members : State & Methods : Behaviour of the Object.

	class class_name{

	};

* Object.
	- Object instantiation/creation: (static decleration)
		class_name obj;	

	- Dynamic creation:
		class_name * obj = new class_name();

* Access Specifiers - specifies access restrictions on the class members.
	=> public, private, protected.
	- Default : private.
